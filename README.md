### Hi there, my name is Michel Fernandes! 👋

I've been 🎓 teaching Computer Vision and Python for AI since 2018 at [FIAP](www.fiap.com.br) for post-graduate courses, such as the [MBA in Machine Learning](https://www.fiap.com.br/mba/mba-em-artificial-intelligence-e-machine-learning/). Feel free to check my repos and review some codes and lectures 😜.

Also I lead the tech track of the BeyondLabs, the innovation center of [EY](www.ey.com.br).

I love sci-fi 🚀 authors. My favorities are: Arthur C. Clarke ([Childhood's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood%27s_End), [Rendezvous with Rama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama)), Cixin Liu ([Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))) and Isaac Asimov (all 😍).
