### Hi there, my name is Michel Fernandes! 👋

I've been 🎓 teaching Computer Vision and Python for AI since 2018 at [FIAP](www.fiap.com.br) for post-graduate courses, such as the [MBA in Machine Learning](https://www.fiap.com.br/mba/mba-em-artificial-intelligence-e-machine-learning/). Feel free to check my repos and review some code and lectures 😜.

I lead the tech vision of digital products of manufacturing operations at [John Deere](https://www.deere.com).

Also, I have a course about face classification at Alura. Please, [enroll](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/analise-classificacao-faces-visao-computacional-opencv) if you like the traditional approaches in this field!

I love sci-fi 🚀 authors. My favorities are: Arthur C. Clarke ([Childhood's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood%27s_End), [Rendezvous with Rama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama)), Cixin Liu ([Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))) and Isaac Asimov (all 😍).

Catholic ⛪ and opinions my own!
